## Frontend Development Documentation

Technology Stack
Next.js 14: For building the frontend UI.
NextAuth.js: User authentication and session management.
Chart.js: For analytics and reporting.
ShadcnUI: For responsive and clean UI design.

### Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Frontend Setup

1.1 User Input Interface
Task: Build a form for users to input the companyâ€™s careers page URL and user details (e.g., job seeker or business executive).
Tools: Next.js 14, TailwindCSS.
Description: Create a simple form with data validation and handle state using React hooks or Next.js state management.
Output: Functional UI for input collection.
1.0 To further enhance this functionality and make it more user-friendly, you could:

1. Create separate UI flows for job seekers and business executives in your frontend application.
   For job seekers:
   Allow them to input a job listing URL or paste a job description.
   Use the scraper to extract job details if a URL is provided.
   Generate a personalized email using the job_application template.
   For business executives:
   Allow them to input details about the target company and industry.
   Use the business_outreach template for email generation.
   Incorporate the portfolio matching to include relevant project links.
   Implement a user-friendly interface for both user types to review and edit the generated emails before sending or saving them.
   Add a feature to save generated emails and track outreach efforts.
   1.2 Data Display and Email Preview
   Task: Display the scraped job listings and show a preview of the generated cold email.
   Tools: Next.js dynamic rendering, ShadcnUI for styling.
   Description: Create a display section to show job listings from the scraped data and dynamically generate an email preview based on job descriptions.
   Output: Real-time email preview and job listing view.
   1.3 API Integration
   Task: Connect frontend to the backend API for job scraping and email generation.
   Tools: Axios or Fetch API.
   Description: Set up API calls to the backend (Python/Streamlit) to fetch job listings and generated emails.
   Output: Seamless communication between frontend and backend, with dynamic data flow.

### Phase 2: Advanced Features and Enhancements

2.1 User Authentication
Task: Implement authentication (login/signup).
Tools: NextAuth.js.
Description: Secure access to the platform by setting up user authentication. Allow users to save job listings and generated emails.
